This is done so the stereo streaming audio will work properly.  Intended primarily for car Bluetooth systems.  Also automatically captures location information so you can find where you left your car.  The location can also be automatically captured when exiting Car Mode on your Android device.  The location can be read by any app that understands GPS data such as Google Maps, GPS Status, web browsers, etc.  A2DP Volume version 2.2.0 and above can also read out text messages using Text To Speech (TTS) services while you are connected. Each paired Bluetooth device or virtual device (home dock, car dock, power connection, or headset plug) can be configured to your liking. \\n\\nThis app has experienced scope creep now and it does much more than originally intended.  In addition to the media volume and location features, it now can automatically launch apps and shortcuts, connect to another Bluetooth device when the first device connects, and turn OFF WIFI and turn ON GPS when a device is active.  Since version 2.2.0 it can also read your text messages for you when connected to a device.  Since 2.11.0 it can also read certain notification messages. That feature can help reduce driver distraction.  A2DP Volume also works with car docks, home docks, and the headset plug.  Rather than just global features, each feature can be configured by device so you can completely customize your control.\\n\\nThis application requires Android 6.0 or higher.  \\n\\nOne of the goals of this app is to eliminate unnecessary driver distractions.  By automatically handling certain settings and events the driver can leave the phone in a pocket or purse and keep their eyes on the road where they belong.  We have purposely not implemented several feature requests that would have required interaction while driving.\\n\\nThis app does not pair Bluetooth devices.  Follow the instructions for your devices to pair them using Android. You must pair your Bluetooth devices before using this app.\\n\\nThis app was created for use by the developers.  We make no money from it at all.  It is free, open source, contains no ads, and collects no data. Once we created it we simply felt others could benefit from it as well so why not give it away.  We have other day jobs.  This is just a hobby.\\n\\n== User Information\\nThe wiki is located link:../../wiki[here].\\n\\nPlease read the link:../../wiki/Manual[manual] to get started.\\n\\nLooking for translators.  So far this app is in US English and translated to German, Danish, and French.  If you want another language supported, post an issue to the issues list with a way to contact you or mailto:jroal@comcast.net[email me] direct.\\n\\nIf you can't get the text message reader working, read link:../../wiki/Reading-Messages[this].\\n\\nFor known issues, see link:../../issues[the issue list]\\n\\nIf you want to be part of the testers group to get access to alpha and beta versions, go here  https://play.google.com/apps/testing/a2dp.Vol[https://play.google.com/apps/testing/a2dp.Vol].\\n\\nI keep a blog for major changes link:http://a2dpvolume.blogspot.com/[http://a2dpvolume.blogspot.com/]\\n\\n== Basic Install\\n\\n. Pair device using the Android settings screen.  +[menu key] -> [Settings] -> [Wireless & networks] -> [Bluetooth settings] -> [Scan for devices]+.  Your device will need to show connected on this screen.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-wuRA9I0RM[Here] is a video explaining it.  \\n. Install my app from the Android Market or this website. \\n. In my app, click +[Load Devices]+.  This should return a list of paired Bluetooth devices.  Your Bluetooth will need to be ON for this to work.  That means the Bluetooth symbol should be in the status bar area.  If it is not ON this app will attempt to turn it ON when finding devices.  If you plan to use this app with home dock, car dock, or the audio jack, you need to first select that in the preferences.  See manual for details.\\n. Select each Bluetooth device from the list in my app.  Short click on the device in the list will open a dialog box so you can configure it.  \\n. Click the +[Edit]+ (center button) and you can now edit the specific settings for the Bluetooth device.  Here is where you set options you want for this specific device.  See the manual for more details. \\n. Click the +[Save]+ button when complete. \\n. Back at the main menu in my app, you should see the right button now says \\\"Stop Service\\\".  That means the app is ready to adjust volume and capture location data.  If you were already connected to the Bluetooth device when you installed and configured my app then you will need to disconnect and reconnect for it to trigger the volume and location capture.  \\n\\n\\nIf you can read software code, look in the \\\"code\\\" tab above.  \\n\\n= Issues\\n\\nFor known issues, see link:../../issues[the issue list]\\n\\nPlease submit any bug reports or ideas for future enhancements in the issues list (issues tab above).  Before submitting a new issue, make sure your issues does not already exists on that list.  If it does, you can add comments and star it so you are informed of updates.  Also, please submit error reports if you experience a crash.  Android automates this for you.  When most crashes happen Android provides a dialog that allows you to either force close or report.  Please report.  These reports tell me what happened so I can fix it.\\n\\n= Additional Features\\nYou can name each Bluetooth device with a more meaningful name.  Android native gets the device name from the remote device and does not let you rename it (until Android 4.0 and up).  If you have more than one of those devices, they all look the same in Android except for the MAC address.\\n\\nThe A2DP Connect widget has now (since version 2.13.0.0) been integrated into this app.  This allows you to place Bluetooth device connect/disconnect toggle buttons on your homescreen to allow simple one-click connecting to a Bluetooth A2DP sink.  More detials here: https://github.com/jroal/a2dp-connect2\\n\\nAllows you to configure each device separately to:  \\n\\n  * Capture location on disconnect. Triggers a GPS listener to capture the most accurate location.  If a GPS location of a configurable accuracy is not found in a configurable amount of time, it turns the listener back OFF to save your battery.\\n  * Adjust media volume on connect, restore on disconnect\\n  * Adjust phone in-call volume on connect, restore on disconnect\\n  * Read text messages (SMS) out loud over speaker phone or Bluetooth speakerphone while connected\\n  * Read notification messages (2.11.0 and up) out loud over speaker phone or Bluetooth speakerphone while connected\\n  * Disable WiFi while connected.\\n  * Launch an app, playlist, shortcut, or custom intent on connect and stop it on disconnect\\n  * Force connect a Bluetooth device when the first device connects.  For instance, when you enter Car Mode, force connect an A2DP receiver.\\n  * Enter car mode on connect.\\n\\nThis project was written in Java using the Android SDK.  Parts of the project were leveraged from examples or other open source applications.\\n\\n== Other Details\\nA2DP = Advanced Audio Distribution Profile.  It is a Bluetooth communication profile for streaming stereo audio.  \\n\\nThis application currently only supports US English, French, and German.  I can add support for other languages if people request it.  Add an issue to the issues list for the languages you want supported.  Be prepared to help us with the translations.  If one of the non-English translations is incorrect, please enter an issue for that as well.  Here is more info on what it takes to help with link:../../wiki/Translations[translations].\\n\\nWhy do we create this app for free with no ads?  Good question.  I was really not sure for the longest time until this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJr9QajdCNc[video explained it].  The only donation we would like is good ratings and comments on Google Play Store.  If you can participate in coding, testing, translating, etc we would welcome that help too.  Also, please spread the word to help promote this app.\\n\\nNote:  This application was made available in Android Market starting with version 1.2.1. October 30, 2010. \\n\\nNo warranties or liabilities expressed or implied.  This is a free open source project. There are no ads and we do not collect any data.  \\n\\nThere are clones being sold on the Play Store.  At least one of these is charging for an older version.  Avoid these scams!\\n\\nUse a bar code scanner in your Android device to scan the image below.  This will find the application on the Android Market for you.\\n\\nimage:http://jimroal.com/exe/QR.png[\\\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=a2dp.Vol\\\",link=\\\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=a2dp.Vol\\\"]\\n\\nHere are a few screen shots:\\n\\nimage:http://jimroal.com/A2DPScreens/Main.png[\\\"Main\\\",height=500] \\nimage:http://jimroal.com/A2DPScreens/EditDevice.png[\\\"Edit Device\\\",height=500,float=\\\"left\\\"]\\n\\nClick link:../../wiki/ScreenShots[here]\\nfor more screen shots.\\n\\nClick https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8B87E2415E38D95E[here] for the video.\\n\\n\\nYou can find the app on the Google Play Store \\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=a2dp.Vol[here].\\n\\nI created a simple tester app that can be used to invoke Car Mode and for sending text strings to A2DP Volume simulating a message from an app.  You can get it link:../../wiki/Notification-tester-app[here].\"\n",

(OPTIONAL) **Add `pyenv virtualenv-init` to your shell** to enable auto-activation of virtualenvs. This is entirely optional but pretty useful. See \\\"Activate virtualenv\\\" below.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    echo 'eval \\\"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\\\"' >> ~/.bashrc\\n    ```\\n\\n    **Fish shell note**:  Add this to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`\\n\\n    ```fish\\n    status --is-interactive; and pyenv virtualenv-init - | source\\n    ```\\n\\n    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bashrc`.\\n    \\n3. **Restart your shell to enable pyenv-virtualenv**\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    exec \\\"$SHELL\\\"\\n    ```\\n\\n\\n### Installing with Homebrew (for macOS users)\\n\\nmacOS users can install pyenv-virtualenv with the\\n[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager.\\nThis will give you access to the `pyenv-virtualenv` command. If you have pyenv\\ninstalled, you will also be able to use the `pyenv virtualenv` command.\\n\\n*This is the recommended method of installation if you installed pyenv\\n with Homebrew.*\\n\\n```sh\\nbrew install pyenv-virtualenv\\n```\\n\\nOr, if you would like to install the latest development release:\\n\\n```sh\\nbrew install --HEAD pyenv-virtualenv\\n```\\n\\nAfter installation, you'll still need to do\\n[Pyenv shell setup steps](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout)\\nthen add \\n```sh\\neval \\\"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\\\"\\n```\\nto your shell's `.rc` file (as stated in the caveats). You'll only ever have to do this once.\\n\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n### Using `pyenv virtualenv` with pyenv\\n\\nTo create a virtualenv for the Python version used with pyenv, run\\n`pyenv virtualenv`, specifying the Python version you want and the name\\nof the virtualenv directory. For example,\\n\\n```sh\\npyenv virtualenv 2.7.10 my-virtual-env-2.7.10\\n```\\n\\nwill create a virtualenv based on Python 2.7.10 under `$(pyenv root)/versions` in a\\nfolder called `my-virtual-env-2.7.10`.\\n\\n`pyenv virtualenv` forwards any options to the underlying command that actually\\ncreates the virtual environment (`conda`, `virtualenv`, or `python -m venv`).\\nSee the output of `pyenv virtualenv --help` for details.\\n\\n### Create virtualenv from current version\\n\\nIf there is only one argument given to `pyenv virtualenv`, the virtualenv will\\nbe created with the given name based on the current pyenv Python version.\\n\\n```sh\\n$ pyenv version\\n3.4.3 (set by /home/yyuu/.pyenv/version)\\n$ pyenv virtualenv venv34\\n```\\n\\n\\n### List existing virtualenvs\\n\\n`pyenv virtualenvs` shows you the list of existing virtualenvs and `conda` environments.\\n\\n```sh\\n$ pyenv shell venv34\\n$ pyenv virtualenvs\\n  miniconda3-3.9.1 (created from /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-3.9.1)\\n  miniconda3-3.9.1/envs/myenv (created from /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-3.9.1)\\n  2.7.10/envs/my-virtual-env-2.7.10 (created from /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/2.7.10)\\n  3.4.3/envs/venv34 (created from /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/3.4.3)\\n  my-virtual-env-2.7.10 (created from /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/2.7.10)\\n* venv34 (created from /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/3.4.3)\\n```\\n\\nThere are two entries for each virtualenv, and the shorter one is just a symlink.\\n\\n\\n### Activate virtualenv\\n\\nSome external tools (e.g. [jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi)) might\\nrequire you to `activate` the virtualenv and `conda` environments.\\n\\nIf `eval \\\"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\\\"` is configured in your shell, `pyenv-virtualenv` will automatically activate/deactivate virtualenvs on entering/leaving directories which contain a `.python-version` file that contains the name of a valid virtual environment as shown in the output of `pyenv virtualenvs` (e.g., `venv34` or `3.4.3/envs/venv34` in example above) . `.python-version` files are used by pyenv to denote local Python versions and can be created and deleted with the [`pyenv local`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-local) command.\\n\\nYou can also activate and deactivate a pyenv virtualenv manually:\\n\\n```sh\\npyenv activate <name>\\npyenv deactivate\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Delete existing virtualenv\\n\\nRemoving the directories in `$(pyenv root)/versions` and `$(pyenv root)/versions/{version}/envs` will delete the virtualenv, or you can run:\\n\\n```sh\\npyenv uninstall my-virtual-env\\n```\\n\\nYou can also delete existing virtualenvs by using `virtualenv-delete` command, e.g. you can run:\\n```sh\\npyenv virtualenv-delete my-virtual-env\\n```\\nThis will delete virtualenv called `my-virtual-env`.\\n\\n\\n### virtualenv and venv\\n\\nThere is a [venv](http://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module available\\nfor CPython 3.3 and newer.\\nIt provides an executable module `venv` which is the successor of `virtualenv`\\nand distributed by default.\\n\\n`pyenv-virtualenv` uses `python -m venv` if it is available and the `virtualenv`\\ncommand is not available.\\n\\n\\n### Anaconda and Miniconda\\n\\nYou can manage `conda` environments by `conda create` as same manner as standard Anaconda/Miniconda installations.\\nTo use those environments, you can use `pyenv activate` and `pyenv deactivate`.\\n\\n```sh\\n$ pyenv version\\nminiconda3-3.9.1 (set by /home/yyuu/.pyenv/version)\\n$ conda env list\\n# conda environments:\\n#\\nmyenv                    /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-3.9.1/envs/myenv\\nroot                  *  /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-3.9.1\\n$ pyenv activate miniconda3-3.9.1/envs/myenv\\ndiscarding /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-3.9.1/bin from PATH\\nprepending /home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/miniconda3-3.9.1/envs/myenv/bin to PATH\\n$ python --version\\nPython 3.4.3 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.\\n$ pyenv deactivate\\ndiscarding

From the jungles of southeast Asia, to the desert of Sinai, to the coasts of South America, the scooter was a common sight above battlefields around the world for decades.\\n\\n### A-4E-C Version 2.1.2 Community Update\\n\\nHello, A-4E-C pilots! We hope you are well. This update fixes some bugs and brings the module into compliance with DCS 2.9, currently in OpenBeta. If you play on the main branch, wait to update your A-4E-C installation: this version of the A-4E-C 2.1.2 requires a minimum version of DCS 2.9.0.46801, and older versions of the A-4E-C are incompaible with this version or later. Always ensure servers, clients, and DCS versions are aligned and compatible! \\nAdditional information about what's new this update is available in the changelog below. \\nIf you are interested in learning more about the module, please reach out on Discord! https://discord.gg/tQZbkTQ\\nThank you for flying the A-4E-C!\\n***DO NOT redistribute this mod without permission!***\\n\\n### Contributing Developers\\n\\nGospadin, Heclak, Joshua Nelson, plusnine, Farlander, gyrovague, kryb/Archimaede, Merker, Jones, Nero\\n\\n### Community Contributors\\n\\nSkateZilla, uboats, Dr. Manius, LevelPulse, Cubeboy, Talo, GVad, OpticFlow, pohlinkzei, Coragem, nima3333, Sidekick65, SPINEG, Shadowfrost, Sport, Historiker, rudel-chw, Luciano, Malamem, HellesBelles, Bungo, Corsair016, FlyingHueman, JacobBadShot, JP Gabobo, Drofseh, Rob, ataribaby, Tanuki44, gcask, The Original HoggitDev Team, [Eric Haugen](http://erichaugen.bandcamp.com)\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- Realistic external flight model and engine simulation\\n- Clickable cockpit\\n- Carrier landing and takeoff\\n- Air refueling\\n- AN/APN-153 Doppler Navigation Radar\\n- AN/ASN-41 Navigation Computer\\n- AN/ARC-51 UHF Radio\\n- AN/ARN-25 ADF Automated Direction Finder\\n- AN/ARN-52 TACAN\\n- AN/ARA-63 MCL (ICLS)\\n- AN/APN-141 Radar Altimeter\\n- AN/APG-53A Radar\\n- AN/APR-25 Radar Homing and Warning System (ECM)\\n- AN/ALE-29A Chaff Dispensing System\\n- Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS)\\n- Approach Power Compensator (APC)\\n- AWE-1 Aircraft Weapons Release System (AWRS)\\n- CP-741/A Bombing Computer (CCRP)\\n- AGM-45A Shrike anti-radiation missile (SEAD)\\n- New weapons:\\n  - AN- series WWII munitions: M81, M88\\n  - MK4 HIPEG 20mm gunpod\\n  - Mk-77 napalm canister\\n  - SUU-7 bomblet dispenser\\n- Unique sounds inside and outside the aircraft\\n- User manual (PDF and Kneeboard)\\n\\n### Version 2.1.2 Changelog: Featured Items\\n\\n#### Added\\n- A new NWS (that's Nosewheel Simulation, mind you) makes correcting turns on the ground much easier, and eliminating the \\\"stuck wheel\\\" feeling due to over-braking in taxi.

Reloading or restarting the mission usually fixes this.\\n\\n[See full issue list](https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c/issues/)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nFailure to perform these steps will result in DCS World not recognizing the module, inability to use the module, input errors when using the module, or client integrity check failures on multiplayer servers that require them. Never install the A-4E-C files directly into your DCS World installation files! Installation size is around 1 GB.\\n\\n### STEP 1: Upgrading from an older release\\n\\n- If you are upgrading from an older version of the A-4E-C, completely uninstall your old version. If this is a brand new installation, skip this and move on to Step 2.\\n\\n- First, uninstall the module's files from `%HOMEPATH%\\\\Saved Games\\\\DCS\\\\Mods\\\\aircraft\\\\A-4E-C`\\n\\n- Depending on how old a release you are upgrading from, you may need to reset your A-4E-C input bindings by deleting the contents of `%HOMEPATH%\\\\\\\\Saved Games\\\\DCS\\\\Config\\\\Input\\\\A-4E-C`\\n\\n### STEP 2: Installing the module files\\n\\n- Installation instructions are identical for Standalone and Steam users alike.\\n\\n- Download [the latest official A-4E-C release package](https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c/releases/). Do not download directly from the Github repository.\\n\\n- Place the `Mods\\\\aircraft\\\\A-4E-C` folder in into your Windows user folder's Saved Games folder for DCS. For most users, this can be accessed by pasting `%HOMEPATH%\\\\Saved Games\\\\Saved Games\\\\DCS` into a windows explorer address bar.\\n\\n- If you have installed other DCS World mods, you might already have the `Mods` and `aircraft` folders indicated in the file path. If so, merge the new A-4E-C folder into the existing folders.\\n\\n- **Never install the A-4E-C files directly into your DCS World installation files!**\\n\\n### STEP 3: Verify installation\\n\\nLaunch DCS World. If your installation was successful, the A-4E-C theme icon appears as a option in the main menu:\\n\\n![Image of DCS World Menu with A-4E-C Theme](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518815335013679104/926862242182488136/unknown.png)\\n\\n### Installation Troubleshooting\\n\\nYour correctly installed files should look something like the following image, substituting your Windows account name where the image displays *Partario*. If you're using the openbeta branch of DCS World, the folder might be `DCS.openbeta` instead of `DCS`:\\n\\n![Image of A-4E-C installation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518815335013679104/886633761670828112/unknown.png)\\n\\n- If you have multiple DCS-related folders in your `%HOMEPATH%\\\\\\\\Saved Games`, for example, `DCS`, or `DCS.openbeta`, and are unsure which folder your DCS World installation is using, locate the `dcs_variant.txt` file in the game files. If this file is present, its contents determines the folder structure your DCS World installation is using. Alternately, load DCS world and use the mission editor to create and save a mission. Search this mission file using Windows explorer to locate the proper folder structure.\\n\\n- If you have installed the module correctly but it still isn't showing up, ensure it's enabled in the DCS Module Manager. Note that the A-4E-C is not alphabetically arranged along with the official modules in this list, and will be enumerated near the end of the list.\\n\\n- If you are receiving an authorization error at launch, **you have incorrectly installed the module to your game files**. Remove any and all improperly installed files, then revisit the installation instructions above to correctly installing the module.\\n\\n- If the A-4E-C icon in the DCS main menu shows a default DCS logo, is missing the theme background and music (or you experience crashes when loading a mission), you have incorrectly downloaded the module. [Download the latest official A-4E-C release package](https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c/releases/).\\n\\n- If you can load a mission, but can't take control of the A-4E-C, ensure you have installed [Microsoft's Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 Redistributable libraries](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0). Restart your computer after installation of the appropriate libraries. For most users, this is `vc_redist.x64.exe`. Alternately, ensure your DCS version is at least 2.7.9.1080.\\n\\n- If you can't find the A-4E-C in the Mission Editor, ensure the historical mode filter is disabled by toggling the clock icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:\\n\\n![Image of the Mission Editor pointing out the location of the Historical Filter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518815335013679104/1035712748715249714/unknown.png)\\n\\n### In-Cockpit Troubleshooting\\n\\n- When setting up your controls, press `LCTRL+Enter` to enable the controls indicator. Control binding information and tips for setting up your devices are provided in the kneeboard manual (`RSHIFT+K`).\\n\\n- Always keep the canopy open when communicating with the ground crew.\\n\\n- If you find can't move the throttle, must first adjust the throttle step position. In order to do this, the throttle axis input must be at ZERO. Even if you are a keyboard user, the keyboard controls are adjusting a virtual throttle axis that must be returned to zero before the throttle step position can be adjusted. Use the controls indicator to move the red \\\"ghost\\\" throttle to zero before adjusting the throttle step position.\\n\\n- Ground steering is accomplished by differential braking. There is no nosewheel steering. The nosewheel caster position is visible on the controls indicator. If you don't have rudder pedals, or are struggling with your keybinds, try the Simple Braking (Rudder Assisted) option in the DCS Special Menu for the A-4E-C, or try assigning a modifier to your rudder axis to utilize the Wheelbrake Differential (Single-Axis) input.\\n\\n### Multiplayer Troubleshooting\\n\\n- A DCS standalone server hosting missions with the A-4E-C must have the A-4E-C module installed.\\n\\n- A server can host players who do not have the A-4E-C module installed on missions that feature it, you will need to be ready to get a little hands-on with your mission files. The Mission Editor dictates that any mission with an A4-E-C in it requires the module (just as it would any other aircraft), and it's `.miz` mission files are, in fact, `.zip` files.\\n\\n- Make a copy of your `.miz` file, and rename it with a `.zip` file extension, and unzip it.\\n\\n- Inside, you will find a `mission` file (no extension). Open this file in your text editor of choice (Notepad works just fine), and search for `requiredModules`. Remove the A-4E-C's entry, as shown in this example:\\n\\n```\\n[\\\"requiredModules\\\"] =\\n{\\n     [\\\"A-4E-C\\\"] = \\\"A-4E-C\\\",\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOnce you have completed the edit, save the `mission` file, and re-create a new `.zip` (carefully maintaining proper folder structure, *of course*). Rename your modified mission `.zip` back to a DCS `.miz` file extension instead.\\n\\n- Finally, test your altered mission by yourself or with a friend to ensure it loads properly, and that clients are able to load into the mission or server without the A4-E-C installed. In this instance, DCS will display any A4-E-C units as an untextured Su-27. Players without the module cannot take control of unit, just as if they did not own any other DCS module in a multiplayer mission.\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n### Q: Is it really free?\\n\\n**Yes**! The A-4E-C will remain forever free!\\n\\n### Q: Are there any plans to obtain the Eagle Dynamics SDK, make the module official, or make the module a part of the default DCS install package?\\n\\n**No**, the A-4E-C will continue on as a free and open-source resource anyone can download and install to enjoy.\\n\\n### Q: Can I donate to the A-4E-C project?\\n\\n**No**, we cannot accept donations, but we appreciate your words of support! There are so many good causes out there. Consider donating to one of those instead!\\n\\n### Q: Can I get involved with the A-4E-C project?\\n\\n**Yes**! First, join the [Community A-4E-C Discord server](https://discord.gg/tQZbkTQ) and introduce yourself! We can always use a hand from game artists, programmers or reliable testers as we continue to move the project forward. If you think you have something to contribute, don't hesitate to reach out in the chat.\\n\\n### Q: Are there manuals or tutorials?\\n\\n**Yes**! Locating the NATOPS manual for an A-4E/F is the gold standard for understanding this aircraft, but there is a lot of helpful guidance in the included kneeboard manual. To access the manual:\\n- Once inside the cockpit, open the kneeboard by pressing `RSHIFT+K`\\n- Read the PDF manual in `%HOMEPATH%\\\\\\\\Saved Games\\\\DCS\\\\Mods\\\\aircraft\\\\A-4E-C\\\\Docs` or [read the kneeboard manual online](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_DPA00CWoRfIsqgh7HYabvpFrOdtBxPi)\\n\\nThe [Community A-4E-C Discord server](https://discord.gg/tQZbkTQ) contains a video \\\"hall of fame\\\" featuring high-quality, up-to-date tutorials for all major systems by some of the Community's finest members. Users have also provided manuals in French and Spanish on the discord.\\n\\n### Q: Is there a paint kit I can use to create my own A-4E-C liveries?\\n\\n**Yes**! This [A-4E-C Paintkit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19w_bD8xHJiZpAi1JbA2xyPDJpl9dje-4) includes the aircraft's top, bottom and fuel tanks. See the included liveries for helpful examples setting up your *description.lua* files.\\n\\n- Liveries created for versions of the A-4E-C prior to 2.0 must update the material names in their *description.lua*. You can use the included `description.lua` files to update\\n\\n- Install original or downloaded liveries just as you would for any other module, in `%HOMEPATH%\\\\\\\\Saved Games\\\\DCS\\\\Liveries\\\\A-4E-C`\\n\\n- ***Never put your hard work at risk by installing liveries to the module's files!***\\n\\n### Q: Can I fly the A-4E-C as a tanker?\\n\\n**No**, not at this time.\\n\\n### Q: Will guided weapons like AGM-12 Bullpup or AGM-62 Walleye be added?\\n\\nProbably not, no.\\n\\n### Q: Why doesn't the A-4E-C have a nosewheel steering button?\\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence to suggest that the A-4E had NWS. According to our research, the revisions and reworks relating to the NWS were applied only to -F models. Leaning to use differential braking takes a little time and effort, but it's a worthwhile skill to develop!\\n\\n### Q: Are there any plans to simulate other variants or later models of the A-4?\\n\\n**No**, there are no plans nor keen interest to pursue this, especially since there is a lot left to add and improve one with our beloved A-4E-C. Additionally, the advanced avionics in later models would not be able to be completed in a satisfying manner.\\n\\n### Q: Why doesn't the A-4E-C work with my favorite mission or multiplayer scripting system?\\n\\nSome scripts or other utilities need to be informed of the A-4E-C's existence or other specificities in order to accommodate it. If you know of a mod or script that should accommodate it, be sure to let the author know!\\n\\n### Q: What's the theme song in the DCS main menu?\\n\\n*Crow*, by [Eric Haugen](https://erichaugen.bandcamp.com/releases)\"\n",
