This is a [simple](http://computing.dcu.ie/~humphrys/Notes/Neural/single.neural.html) single layer feedforward neural network (perceptron). We use binary digits as our inputs and expect binary digits as our outputs. We'll use [backpropagation](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) via gradient descent to train our network and make our prediction as accurate as possible.\\n\\n##Dependencies\\n\\nNone! Just numpy.\\n\\n##Usage\\n\\nRun ``python demo.py`` in terminal to see it train, then predict.\\n\\n##Challenge\\n\\nThe challenge for this video is to create a 3 layer feedforward neural network using only numpy as your dependency. By doing this, you'll understand exactly how backpropagation works and develop an intuitive understanding of neural networks, which will be useful for more the more complex nets we build in the future. Backpropagation usually involves recursively taking derivatives, but in our 1 layer demo there was no recursion so was a trivial case of backpropagation. In this challenge, there will be. Use a small binary dataset, you can define one programmatically like in this example.\\n\\n**Bonus -- use a larger, more interesting dataset**\\n\\n##Credits\\n\\nThe credits for this code go to [Milo Harper](https://github.com/miloharper). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.\"\n",

It can take multiple names, locations, languages, years, and methods:\\n\\n```r\\nlibrary(gendrendr)\\ngendr(names = \\\"Sam\\\", years = 1920:2020, locations = \\\"United States\\\", languages = \\\"English\\\", methods = \\\"standard\\\")\\n```\\n\\nIt also makes assumptions about the inputs, so you could functionally run `gendr` with defaults:\\n\\n```r\\ngendr()\\n```\\n\\n## Authors and Contributions\\n\\n**J. L. Simonis** is presently the sole author of `gendrendr`. \\n\\nIf you are interested in contributing, see the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/dapperstats/gendrendr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dapperstats/gendrendr/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\\n\\nThe following individuals made small contributions to the code:\\n* Chuck Leong\\n\\n## About the name and logo\\n\\nThe package is a counter to and commentary on the perpetuation of gender stereotypes in the study of gender. \\n\\nThe name `gendrendr` was proposed by [Lewis Bartlett as an edit to my initial `genderEnder` on the #Rstats twitter](https://twitter.com/BeesAndBaking/status/1189372151268282368) and means \\\"one who ends gender\\\", which I believe to be a righteous label for oneself. I am a gender-ender. #LGBTQIAinSTEM #NBinSTEM\\n\\nThe logo includes the [&#8709; symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set), which means an \\\"empty set\\\" and is used by some non-binary (specifically, [neutrois](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Neutrois)) individuals as a symbol to reference themselves. I use this symbol personally. The brick motif and the &#8709;'s arm \\\"breaking\\\" it are a reference to [Stonewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) and the use of building materials ([bricks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/first-brick-at-stonewall-lgbtq.html)) to start riots, breakdown buildings, and dismantle structures. The green color is presently not part of the USAmerican gender color schema.\"\n",
